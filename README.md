SeWAT - Secure Web Application Toolkit, is an auto-generation toolkit that allows developers to automatically generate a set of files (Spring Security configuration file, MySQL RBAC database's schema creation script, ...), in order to enforce a role-based access control in an already existing web application. ControlAccess tool is a set of Eclipse plug-ins that supports Model-to-Model and Model-to-Text transformations, it also offers a graphical modeling workbench for web applications.

ControlAccess tool enables developers to:

\begin{itemize}
    \vspace{0.5em} 
    \item Graphically model an MVC web application. This model will serve as an input for the code generation plug-ins.
    \item Generate a set a files from the web application's model and UML diagrams. This set of files will, then, be integrated in an already existing web application in order to enforce a role-based access control,
\end{itemize}


Anyone wanting to successfully and easily use this tool should have a basic knowledge on Model Driven Engineering MDE, Role-based Access Control, Eclipse EMF, J2EE and Spring MVC.
